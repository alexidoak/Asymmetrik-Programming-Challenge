# Asymmetrik-Programming-Challenge
Mobile device keyboard autocomplete algorithm implementation.
I developed this code in Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, Version: Mars.2 Release (4.5.2)
To run:
1. Save download the repository.
2. In the terminal cd into the bin directory.
3. Run `java AutocompleteProvider`
 * To quit, enter `quit`.
 * The program is going to ask you whether you are training the algorithm. Enter "yes" or "no".
    * If `yes`, enter in the phrase you want to train with.
    * If `no`, enter in the fragment you would like to the algorithm to provide autocomplete suggestions for. The program will output a list of autocomplete suggestions.
    
Thank you for this opportunity!
